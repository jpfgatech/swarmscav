- [x] **Feature: Demon Entity & Visuals**
    - *Goal*: Define the Demon agent type.
    - *State*: Add `activeDemons` list (initially empty).
    - *Visuals*:
        -   **Color**: **Brick Red** (`hsl(0, 60%, 40%)`). (Lower saturation as requested).
        -   **Shape**: Same radius as Targets/Normal agents.
    - *Logic*:
        -   **Channel B Binding**: Ensure Demons freeze when `Ctrl/Right-Tap` is held (same as Targets).
        -   **Collision**: Check `distance(Hero, Demon) < HitRadius`. If true -> **Game Over**.
    - *Verify*: Manually push a demon into the array and confirm it looks correct and kills the player.
